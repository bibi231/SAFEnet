    <h1>About SAFEnet</h1>
    <p class="lead">Secure Anonymous Feedback & Emergency Network</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
        SAFEnet was created to provide a safe, secure, and anonymous platform for reporting incidents
        and emergencies in Abuja, Nigeria. We believe that everyone deserves access to help and support,
        regardless of their circumstances or ability to identify themselves.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Submit a Report:</strong> Fill out our anonymous form with details about the incident</li>
        <li><strong>Get a Tracking Code:</strong> Receive a unique code to monitor your report's progress</li>
        <li><strong>We Connect You:</strong> Verified service providers are notified and assigned</li>
        <li><strong>Receive Help:</strong> Providers reach out through safe channels to assist you</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Privacy & Security</h2>
    <p>
        Your privacy is our top priority. SAFEnet is designed with privacy-by-design principles:

        <li>We comply with the Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Our Partners</h2>
    <p>
