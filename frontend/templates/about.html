    <h2 id="mission">Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
        SAFEnet was created to provide a safe, secure, and anonymous platform for reporting incidents
        and emergencies in Abuja, Nigeria. We believe that everyone deserves access to help and support,
        regardless of their circumstances or ability to identify themselves.
